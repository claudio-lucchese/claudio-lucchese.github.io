class="cmbx-10">Abstract. </span>A major mining task for binary matrixes is the extraction of
approximate top-<span 
class="cmmi-10">k </span>patterns that are able to concisely describe the input data. The
top-<span 
class="cmmi-10">k </span>pattern discovery problem is commonly stated as an optimization one,
where the goal is to minimize a given cost function, e.g., the accuracy of the
data description. In this work, we review several greedy algorithms, and
discuss <span 
class="cmcsc-10">P<span 
class="small-caps">a</span>ND<span 
class="small-caps">a</span></span><span 
class="cmr-7">+</span>, an algorithmic framework able to optimize diﬀerent cost
functions generalized into a unifying formulation. We evaluated the goodness
of the algorithm by measuring the quality of the extracted patterns. We
adapted standard quality measures to assess the capability of the algorithm
to discover both the items and transactions of the patterns embedded in
the data. The evaluation was conducted on synthetic data, where patterns
were artiﬁcially embedded, and on real-world text collection, where each
document is labeled with a topic. Finally, in order to qualitatively evaluate
the usefulness of the discovered patterns, we exploited <span 
class="cmcsc-10">P<span 
class="small-caps">a</span>ND<span 
class="small-caps">a</span></span><span 
class="cmr-7">+</span> to detect
overlapping communities in a bipartite network. The results show that <span 
class="cmcsc-10">P<span 
class="small-caps">a</span>ND<span 
class="small-caps">a</span></span><span 
class="cmr-7">+</span>
is able to discover high-quality patterns in both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >We discuss the results of using <span 
class="cmcsc-10">P<span 
class="small-caps">a</span>ND<span 
class="small-caps">a</span></span><span 
class="cmr-7">+</span> as a tool to identify communities from
bipartite graphs extracted from a real-wold dataset. To this end, we mined a dump of
the DBLP database, spanning a period that goes from January 2008 to July 2013.
We built a bipartite graph of <span 
class="cmti-10">authors </span>and <span 
class="cmti-10">publication venues</span>, where an edge links
an author <span 
class="cmmi-10">a </span>to a publication venue <span 
class="cmmi-10">v </span><span 
class="cmti-10">iﬀ  </span><span 
class="cmmi-10">a </span>published at least a paper at
conference/journal <span 
class="cmmi-10">v </span>regardless the year of publication. We discarded authors who
published in less than 5 venues, and venues that hosted less than 40 distinct authors.
We also removed the venue “Computing Research Repository” (CoRR), which is a
free online multi-disciplinary repository and it is not useful to our purpose of
detecting topical communities. From this bipartite graph, we generated the
incidence binary matrix <span 
class="cmsy-10">𝒟</span>, where rows are authors and columns are venues. The
resulting binary matrix <span 
class="cmsy-10">𝒟 </span>includes <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>= 112<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>261 authors, and <span 
class="cmmi-10">M </span>= 4<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>283
venues.
<!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   We run <span 
class="cmcsc-10">P<span 
class="small-caps">a</span>ND<span 
class="small-caps">a</span></span><span 
class="cmr-7">+</span> <span 
class="cmmi-10">J</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">E</span></sub> (with <span 
class="cmmi-10">R </span>= 20 and correlation item ordering) by varying the
two maximum noise thresholds <span 
class="cmmi-10">𝜖</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">r</span></sub> and <span 
class="cmmi-10">𝜖</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">c</span></sub>. After testing several combinations, we
observed that all of them are very useful for studying, inspecting and understanding
the diverse overlapping social communities present in the bipartite DBLP graph.
Small noise thresholds generate small communities covering a very speciﬁc
topic. By increasing the noise thresholds, it is possible to analyze how the
communities merge together into wider topics. Due to space constraints, we
only discuss two parameter conﬁgurations: (i) <span 
class="cmmi-10">𝜖</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">r</span></sub> = 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>0, <span 
class="cmmi-10">𝜖</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">c</span></sub> = 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>0, and (ii)
<span 
class="cmmi-10">𝜖</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">r</span></sub> = 0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>5, <span 
class="cmmi-10">𝜖</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">c</span></sub> = 0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>8. In the case <span 
class="cmti-10">(i) </span>we do not give any constraint over the
amount of noise contained in each pattern, so that the noise is only limited by
cost function <span 
class="cmmi-10">J</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">E</span></sub>. In the case <span 
class="cmti-10">(ii) </span>instead, any extracted pattern should
contain authors that published in at least 50% of the pattern&#x2019;s venues, and
venues that contain at least 20% of the pattern&#x2019;s authors. The setting <span 
class="cmti-10">(ii) </span>of
the two parameters is reasonable, considering that there are many more
authors than venues. The algorithms <span 
class="cmcsc-10">A<span 
class="small-caps">s</span><span 
class="small-caps">s</span><span 
class="small-caps">o</span> </span>and <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">y</span><span 
class="small-caps">p</span><span 
class="small-caps">e</span><span 
class="small-caps">r</span>+ </span>were not able to
complete within one hour and therefore they are not discussed here. This is
because their implementation does not handle eﬃcently large and sparse
data.
<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   It is worth remarking that DBLP does not always disambiguate homonymous
authors. As a result, <span 
class="cmcsc-10">P<span 
class="small-caps">a</span>ND<span 
class="small-caps">a</span></span><span 
class="cmr-7">+</span> extracted a pattern with more than 50 venues and as
little as 200 authors. By manual inspection, we found that the venues of the pattern
covered very diﬀerent topics, and that authors has common Chinese surnames (e.g.,
Li, Liu, Wang, Yang, Zhang, etc.). This pattern was clearly due to the presence
of homonymous authors, and we thus did not consider it in the following
discussion.
<!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >   Fig. <a 
href="#x1-21">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:DBLP --></a> shows the top-16 patterns extracted by <span 
class="cmcsc-10">P<span 
class="small-caps">a</span>ND<span 
class="small-caps">a</span></span><span 
class="cmr-7">+</span> <span 
class="cmmi-10">J</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">E</span></sub>. Each pattern is
represented by a node, whose label was manually chosen according to the venues
composing it. The size of the node is proportional to the number of authors
                                                                  

                                                                  
contained, whereas the number of venues is shown between parentheses. The sharing
of authors among patterns is instead captured by the thickness of the edges. Finally,
nodes are placed according to their extraction order, the ﬁrst being the rightmost and
then proceeding counter-clock wise.
<!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >   When using the larger noise thresholds of case <span 
class="cmti-10">(i)</span>, see Fig. <a 
href="#x1-21">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:DBLP --></a>a, the extracted
patterns are larger. <span 
class="cmti-10">Communications </span>is the largest pattern, and it has a signiﬁcant
sharing of authors with <span 
class="cmti-10">Networking</span>. Despite the strong sharing of authors, there is
only one overlapping venue (ICC). By inspecting the patterns&#x2019; venues in Table <a 
href="#x1-10011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:venue-clusters --></a>, the
reader can appreciate that although the topics of the two patterns are related, they
are separated enough: the former is concerned with low level signal transmissions,
whereas the latter mainly regards network protocols. Other strong links are present
between <span 
class="cmti-10">Operational Research </span>and <span 
class="cmti-10">Neural Networks </span>and between <span 
class="cmti-10">Pattern Recognition</span>
and <span 
class="cmti-10">Communications</span>.
<!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >   Interestingly enough, the IEEE TKDE journal falls into the <span 
class="cmti-10">Data Mining &#x0026;</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Management </span>pattern. The cluster of venues appears to be very reasonable, including
some information retrieval conferences (e.g., WSDM). Also, it contains the most
inﬂuential authors in the Data Mining ﬁeld according to Microsoft Academic Search:
Jiawei Han, Philip S. Yu, Rakesh Agrawal, Christos Faloutsos, Hans-Peter Kriegel,
Eamonn J. Keogh, George Karypis, and Heikki Mannila. Finally, readers of this
journal may appreciate the quality of the venue groups <span 
class="cmti-10">Algorithmica </span>and <span 
class="cmti-10">High</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Performace Computing</span>.
<!--l. 156--><p class="indent" >   Fig. <a 
href="#x1-21">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:DBLP --></a>b shows the top-16 patterns extracted with the less tolerant conﬁguration
of case <span 
class="cmti-10">(ii)</span>. Due to space constraints, we do not illustrate in detail their
venue composition. We observe, that the extracted patterns have a ﬁner
granularity. The previous <span 
class="cmti-10">Communications </span>related clusters are now separated in
more focused groups: <span 
class="cmti-10">Wireless Networks</span>, which includes ICC, VTC Spring,
GLOBECOM, and WCNC, <span 
class="cmti-10">Communications</span>, made up of ICC, GLOBECOM, IEEE
Communications Letters, and IEEE Transactions on Communications, <span 
class="cmti-10">Vehicular</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Technology</span>, composed of CC, PIMRC, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology
and IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, and, ﬁnally, <span 
class="cmti-10">Signal</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Processing</span>, which is composed of ICASSP and IEEE Transactions on Signal
Processing.
<!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >   Another interesting example is given by the <span 
class="cmti-10">Pattern Recognition </span>cluster, which is
now separated from the 3 related sub-ﬁelds of <span 
class="cmti-10">Signal Processing</span>, <span 
class="cmti-10">Audio Processing</span>
and <span 
class="cmti-10">Image Processing</span>, each of them having a large author overlap with the new more
focused <span 
class="cmti-10">Pattern Recognition </span>pattern. Note is also well connected to <span 
class="cmti-10">Wireless</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Networks</span>.
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   Finally, note that in both Fig. <a 
href="#x1-21">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:DBLP --></a>a and Fig. <a 
href="#x1-21">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:DBLP --></a>b there is a pattern labeled
by <span 
class="cmti-10">IEICE</span>, composed of a single venue, namely IEICE Transactions, which
contains an abnormal number of authors (about 6,000). It is a publication of
an Asiatic organization which mainly contains papers on electronics and
communications.
